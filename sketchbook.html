            I started this project when we only had two cats, Jack and Lily. Now we have a third, Nikita "Niki" so at some point she needs to be in a portrait as well.
            I wanted to show their personalities within their facial expressions. Jack who is a laid-back but playful lump and Lily who is a little more uptight, a one 
            person cat, and my closest companion. I wanted to play with sunlight on their fur and the light in their eyes. I'm still working on that. I paused on this project
            because I grew frustrated with my vision of Lily not coming through in the paint. After some time away I don't think that is as much of an issue as I'd originally thought. 
            I feel I really captured Jack's personality. He often has this wide-eyed innocent look about him and I feel this comes through in my rendition. 
            Water soluble oils are a new medium for me. I was pleasantly surprised by the similarity to regular oil paints. The drying time is much quicker but not as quick 
            as acrylics and that is a good thing I feel. They also clean up easier and smell better. Using water instead of solvent to thin the paint and clean the brush is a much
            nicer experience. I will continue to work on this project as I have time. Eventually I want to create portraits of all the animals my husband and I have adopted over
            the years, so this idea may take up a lot of my time in the future.
